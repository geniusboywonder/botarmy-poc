## Findings

| Item Description                                      | Issue                                                                                          | Location/Module                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **1. Mock Data Usage**                               | Mock data is used in several components instead of fetching real data from the API.          | `src/components/UserList.jsx`       |
|                                                       | - Replace mock data with API calls to ensure real data is displayed.                          |                                      |
| **2. Missing API Integration**                        | Components do not integrate with the back-end API for user authentication and data retrieval. | `src/services/api.js`               |
|                                                       | - Implement API calls using Axios or Fetch to connect with the back-end services.             |                                      |
| **3. Code Duplication**                               | Similar logic for data fetching is repeated in multiple components.                            | `src/components/UserList.jsx`       |
|                                                       | - Refactor data fetching logic into a custom hook (e.g., `useFetch`) to promote reusability. |                                      |
| **4. Console Errors**                                 | Console warnings related to missing keys in lists and invalid prop types.                      | `src/components/UserList.jsx`       |
|                                                       | - Ensure that all list items have unique keys and validate prop types using PropTypes.        |                                      |
| **5. Incomplete Error Handling**                      | Lack of error handling for API calls, leading to unhandled promise rejections.                | `src/services/api.js`               |
|                                                       | - Implement try-catch blocks or `.catch()` for error handling in API calls.                  |                                      |
| **6. State Management Issues**                        | State management is not optimized, leading to unnecessary re-renders.                         | `src/components/UserList.jsx`       |
|                                                       | - Consider using React Context or Redux for global state management.                          |                                      |
| **7. Styling Inconsistencies**                        | Inconsistent styling practices across components.                                             | `src/components/`                    |
|                                                       | - Standardize styling using CSS modules or styled-components for consistency.                 |                                      |
| **8. Lack of Unit Tests**                             | No unit tests are present for critical components.                                            | `src/components/`                    |
|                                                       | - Implement unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure component reliability.  |                                      |
| **9. Unused Imports**                                 | Several components contain unused imports, leading to clutter.                                | `src/components/UserList.jsx`       |
|                                                       | - Remove unused imports to clean up the codebase.                                            |                                      |
| **10. Accessibility Issues**                          | Missing ARIA attributes and semantic HTML elements.                                           | `src/components/UserList.jsx`       |
|                                                       | - Improve accessibility by adding ARIA roles and ensuring proper HTML semantics.              |                                      |
