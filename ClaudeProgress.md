Checkpoint Summary: I've successfully implemented the modular architecture with:
✅ Main Orchestrator (backend_generator.py) - Lightweight coordinator
✅ Base Classes - BaseManager and BaseGenerator interfaces
✅ App Core Manager (Complete) - FastAPI, Config, Database, LLM Client generators
✅ Data Models Manager (Structure) - Manager class created
✅ Utilities Manager (Structure + 1 generator) - Manager + ErrorHandler generator
Progress Status:

Core Pattern Established: The modular pattern is working well with clear separation of concerns
Consistent Interfaces: All managers follow BaseManager, all generators follow BaseGenerator
Fallback Strategy: Each generator has comprehensive fallback templates
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling built into the base classes
Statistics Tracking: Each manager and generator tracks generation metrics

Next Steps for Complete Implementation:

- Agent System Manager - Base agent, agent manager, registry
- Workflow Manager - Pipeline, state manager, message queue
- Infrastructure Manager - Deployment, monitoring

Check that when complying with the code protocol you are renaming the final completed files correctly without the WIP_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS standard.
