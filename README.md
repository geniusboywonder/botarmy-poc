# 🤖 BotArmy POC

BotArmy POC is a proof-of-concept project designed to **create, manage, and coordinate multiple AI agents** working together to accomplish complex tasks efficiently and safely.

## ✨ Features

* 🔧 **Modular Agent Architecture** – Easy to extend and customize
* ⚡ **High Performance** – Efficient task processing and resource management
* 🛡️ **Type Safety** – Full TypeScript support with strict typing
* 📊 **Monitoring & Health Checks** – Built-in agent monitoring and reporting
* 🔄 **Task Queue Management** – Priority-based task scheduling
* 🎯 **Capability Matching** – Intelligent task-to-agent assignment
* 🔒 **Security First** – Secure by design with proper validation
* 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing** – Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is designed around **AI Agents** that:

* Receive **tasks** from a queue
* Use **capability matching** to assign the right agent to the right job
* Report **status & health** to monitoring tools
* Operate in a **modular and extensible** way, making it easy to plug in new agents
